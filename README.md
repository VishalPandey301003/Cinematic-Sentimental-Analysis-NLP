# Cinematic Sentiments: Analyzing Movie Reviews Using NLP

## Overview
Cinematic Sentiments is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on analyzing movie reviews to determine sentiment. The project leverages Python, machine learning, and statistical methods to preprocess text data and extract features, ultimately optimizing the performance of sentiment classification models.

## Features

### Data Preprocessing
- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into meaningful units.
- **Stop Words Removal**: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to sentiment (e.g., "and", "the").
- Tools: Leveraged the **NLTK toolkit** for these tasks.

### Feature Extraction
- **Count Vectorizer**: Converts text data into a matrix of token counts.
- **TF-IDF**: Computes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency for advanced feature extraction.

### Model Optimization
- **Algorithms**: Optimized **Logistic Regression** and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
- **Achievements**: 
  - Improved model accuracy by **20%**.
  - Boosted performance by **15%** through hyperparameter tuning.
